# Introduction to API
Introduction to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

### Definition
A broad definition: an API is a set of commands, functions, protocols and objects       
that programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system.     

### Example
jQuery it's an API, 
It's something that gives you access to a whole bunch of functions and objects       
that let you create software much more easily than if you were just writing vanilla Javascript.      

For every website that has their own data, be it Facebook, which has data     
on their users, or something like the police API, which has data on crimes,     
thereâ€™s certain pieces of data that they will allow you to access,     
but there's other pieces of data that are confidential.      

API concepts:
* Endpoint:        
Any API that interacts with a external system, like a server, will have an endpoint.     
The endpoint of the API is an URL
* Paths
* Parameters
* Authentification
